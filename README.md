## About Me

I believe in making **free and open source projects** for everyone to use and enjoy. 

When I'm not coding, I can also be found behind a camera, looking out at the world through my lens. While photography is merely a hobby for most, it's my way of looking at the world and sharing the beauty found in everyday moments.
